            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p><strong>Jermaine Lamarr Cole</strong> famously known as <strong>J. Cole </strong>was born on january 28, 1985 at an american military base in Germany and was raised in Fayetteville, North Carolina. J is an american rapper and record producer who innitially gained attention with his debut mixtape, <em>The Come Up</em> in early 2007. His writting style has tremendously changed since he started to rap at the age of 12. he has progressively finetuned and polished his art and mastered it. His improvement ws not going to waste as he was getting more and more recognization with every new rap song he released. His very first signing was in 2009 with a record lable and entertainment company named <em>Roc Nation</em> which was founded by American Rapper <strong>Jay Z</strong>. Matter fact, J was the very first artist that Jay Z's record lable signed since it started in 2008. J. Cole released his second mixtape called <em>The Warm Up</em> gaining positive reviews in 2009 under Roc Nation and soon appeared in Jay Z's album, The Blueprint 3 and from here he was unstopable from achieving greatness in his art. Since he started, he has won a Grammy Award, had six albums peak at #1 in the Billboard Hot 100 and he also had three albums go platinum, with no features or singles. His most streamed song is "No Role Modelz" and has entered the Two Billion Streams Club.  <!--His Most recent hit was with a song he released with another american rapper AKA Drake and the name of his track is "First Person Shooter". From music to lyrics to flows to video visuals to VFX, evrything was out of the hopes of his fans as Cole don't use huge amount of VFS and visuals in his music videos, he emphasises more on the music itself but because of drake, the video was not expected to be this high quality. What makes J. Cole so speacial as a rapper is that he's not only fantastic at what he does but because of the total respect he has for hip hop's past and love for it as it is now. -->
